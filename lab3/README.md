DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains code for our Scheduling Process implementations. Our code
is almost complete, containing the majority of the functionality listed in the
document write up. It is fully functional for MFQS and RTS, but does not work for
HS.

TO RUN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our code is run by first compiling with the command “make”.

The compiled files can also be removed with the command “make clean”. 

After the files are compiled, the program can be run with the `sched` command and
the by following on screen instructions.
